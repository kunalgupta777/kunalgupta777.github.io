A navigatory aid, utilising successively improved object detection frameworks like MobileNet SSDs and YOLO for object detection and processing the data to produce voice commands for the visually challenged. IP Webcam Pro was used to relay live video feed from the phone camera ( which essentially works as the "eye" for the user ), and using YOLO in OpenCV for object detection on a remote server and sending audio commands that are heard through the mobile device's speakers.
